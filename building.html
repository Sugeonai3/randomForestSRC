<a id="Zcreating_installing_cran"></a><h3>Creating and Installing the randomForestSRC R Package</h3>

<p> To create the R package using the GitHub repository, you will need
an installation of R (> v3.0) that is capable of compiling
source code packages containing C-code.  This means that the
approprate C-code compilers need to be in place and accessible by the
R packaging and installation engine.
Detailed descriptions on how this is achieved are available
on a number of sites online and will not be reproduced here.
You will also need Apache Ant (v1.10), and Java JDK (v1.80). Once the
R package development environment is in place, it is possible to build
our package natively on your platform using the following steps:
</p>

<p>From the top-level directory (the directory containing <code>build.xml</code>), the command
</p>

<p><code>ant</code></p>

<p>
will give you several options.  The command
</p>

<p><code>ant source-cran</code></p>

<p>
will create the R source code package directory-tree
<code>./target/cran/randomForestSRC/</code>. To
install randomForestSRC in your default library, change to the
directory <code>./target/cran/</code> and type
</p>

<p><code>R CMD INSTALL --preclean --clean randomForestSRC</code></p>

<p>
This will install an OpenMP parallel version of the package if the
host system is capable of supporting this mode of execution.

<p> Please note than on some platforms, even though an OpenMP C-compiler
may have ben installed, the R packaging and installation engine does
not pick up the appropriate compiler.  For example, on macOS, the
default compiler is Clang.  It is not OpenMP capable out-of-the-box.
You will need to install an OpenMP version of it, or install GCC using
Homebrew or another package manager.  Most importantly, you will also need to direct the R packaging and installtion
engine to the OpenMP capable compiler. This is done by
creating an <code>.R</code> directory in your <code>HOME</code> directory, and
creating a <code>Makevars</code> file in that directory containing
the appropriate compiler instructions. As an example, on macOS Sierra
(v10.12) our installation has the following as its
<code>Makevars</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="R">
F77 = gfortran-7
FC  = gfortran-7
CC  = gcc-7
CXX = g++-7
CFLAGS = -I/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.2.0/include
LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/7.2.0/lib/gcc/7
</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>OpenMP Parallel Processing &ndash; Setting the Number of CPUs</h4>

<p>There are several ways to control the number of CPU cores that the
package accesses during OpenMP parallel execution.  First, you will
need to determine the number of cores on your local machine.  Do this
by starting an R session and issuing the command
<code>detectCores()</code>.  You will require the <span class="pkg">parallel</span> package
for this.
</p>
<p>Then you can do the following:
</p>
<p>At the start of every R session, you can set the number of cores
accessed during OpenMP parallel execution by issuing the command
<code>options(rf.cores = x)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the number of
cores.  If <code>x</code> is a negative number, the package will access
the maximum number of cores on your machine.  The options command can
also be placed in the users .Rprofile file for convenience.  You can,
alternatively, initialize the environment variable <code>RF_CORES</code>
in your shell environment.
</p>
<p>The default value for rf.cores is -1 (-1L), if left unspecified, which
uses all available cores, with a minimum of two.
</p>

<h4>R-side Parallel Processing &ndash; Setting the Number of CPUs</h4>

<p>The package also implements R-side parallel processing via the
<code>parallel</code> package contained in the base <code>R</code>
distribution.  However, the <code>parallel</code> package must be explicitly loaded to take
advantage of this functionality.  When this is the case, the 
R function <code>lapply()</code> is replaced with the parallel version
<code>mclapply()</code>.  You can
set the number of cores accessed by <code>mclapply()</code> by issuing
the command
</p>
<p><code>options(mc.cores = x)</code>
</p>
<p>where <code>x</code> is the number of cores.  The options command
can also be placed in the users .Rprofile file for convenience.  You
can, alternatively, initialize the environment variable
<code>MC_CORES</code> in your shell environment.  See the help files in
<span class="pkg">parallel</span> for more information.
</p>
<p>The default value for <code>mclapply()</code> on non-Windows systems is
two (2L) cores.  On Windows systems, the default value is one (1L)
core.
</p>

<h4>Example: Setting the Number of CPUs</h4>

<p>As an example, issuing the following options command uses all
available cores for both OpenMP and R-side processing:
</p>
<p><code>options(rf.cores=detectCores(), mc.cores=detectCores())</code>
</p>
<p>As stated above, this option command can be placed in the users
.Rprofile file.
</p>

<h4>Cautionary Note on Parallel Execution</h4>

<ol>
<li><p> Once the package has been compiled with OpenMP enabled, trees
will be grown in parallel using the <code>rf.cores</code> option.
Independently of this, we also utilize <code>mclapply()</code> to
parallelize loops in R-side pre-processing and post-processing
of the forest.  This is always available and independent of
whether the user chooses to compile the package with the OpenMP
option enabled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> It is important to NOT write programs that fork R processes
containing OpenMP threads.  That is, one should not use
<code>mclapply()</code> around the functions <code>rfsrc()</code>,
<code>predict.rfsrc()</code>, <code>vimp.rfsc()</code>,
<code>var.select.rfsrc()</code>, <code>find.interaction.rfsrc()</code> and <code>partial.rfsrc()</code>.
In such a scenario, program execution is not guaranteed.
</p>

<a id="Zthe_apache_spark_pkg"></a><h2>The Apache Spark Package</h2>

<p> This effort is VERY PRELIMINARY and not ready for release, beta, or
even alpha.  It is provided as a status update of our efforts and
nothing more.
</p>

<a id="Zcreating_installing_spark"></a><h3>Creating and Installing the
randomForestSRC Spark Package</h3>

<p> To create the Apache Spark package using the GitHub repository, you will need
the following tools:  Apache Ant (v1.10), Java JDK (v1.80), Scala
(v2.12), and Apache Maven (v3.5). You must also have Apache Spark
(v2.1) installed.

<p>From the top-level directory (the directory containing <code>build.xml</code>), the command
</p>

<p><code>ant</code></p>

<p>
will give you several options.  The command
</p>

<p><code>ant source-spark</code></p> will create the Spark source code
package directory-tree <code>./target/spark/</code>. To compile the
the source code package, type

<p><code>ant build-spark</code>.</p>

This will create the Spark target package directory-tree <code>./target/spark/target/</code>. A sample
<em>helloRandomForestSRC</em> program can be executed by changing to
the directory <code>./target/spark/target/</code> and typing

<p><code>./hello.sh</code> or <code>./hello.cmd</code> according to
your operating system.

The source code for the example is located in the GitHub
repository
[<a href="https://github.com/kogalur/randomForestSRC/blob/master/src/test/java/HelloRandomForestSRC.java">here</a>].

It does little more than start a Spark session, grow a forest, and
stop the Spark session.  Details of raw unformatted ensemble
information is presented in a log file <code>rfsrc-x.log</code> in the
users <code>HOME</code> directory, though they are not available for
examination by the user at this point in any coherent way.


<a id="Zjavadoc"></a><h3>Java API Specification for randomForestSRC</h3>
The Java API Specification for randomForestSRC is avaliable [<a
href="javadoc/index.html">here</a>].  It is purely skeletal at this
point, but will be flushed out in more detail in the near future.
